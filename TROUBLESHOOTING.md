# Troubleshooting Guide - "Failed to Fetch" Errors

## ❌ Problem: Cannot Save Anything - "Failed to Fetch" Error

### 🔍 Root Cause
**Render Free Tier Cold Starts**

Your backend on Render Free tier:
- ⏰ **Sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity**
- 🐢 **Takes 30-60 seconds to wake up**
- ⏱️ **First request always times out** if timeout is too short

### ✅ Solutions Applied

#### 1. Increased Timeout (DONE ✅)
- Changed from 10 seconds → **60 seconds**
- Now waits long enough for Render to wake up
- Added automatic retry logic (3 attempts)

#### 2. Better Error Messages (DONE ✅)
- Shows "Backend may be waking up" message
- Explains what's happening to users
- Provides helpful retry suggestions

#### 3. Enhanced Logging (DONE ✅)
- Logs every API call to console
- Shows which URL is being called
- Displays detailed error information

### 🚨 THE #1 FIX YOU NEED: Setup UptimeRobot

**This will solve 90% of your problems!**

#### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Go to:** https://uptimerobot.com
2. **Sign up** (free account)
3. **Add Monitor:**
   - Click "Add New Monitor"
   - Monitor Type: **HTTP(s)**
   - Friendly Name: **NuviaCare Backend**
   - URL: `https://health-management-app-joj5.onrender.com`
   - Monitoring Interval: **5 minutes**
   - Click "Create Monitor"

**Result:**
- ✅ Backend stays awake 24/7
- ✅ No more 30-60 second waits
- ✅ All save operations work instantly
- ✅ Socket.IO connects immediately
- ✅ Better user experience

## 📊 Testing After Fixes

### Step 1: Check Deployment Status

**Netlify:**
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE/deploys
- Check if commit `a067a52` is deployed
- Status should show "Published"

**Vercel:**
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Check latest deployment
- Should show commit `a067a52`

### Step 2: Test in Browser

1. **Open your deployed site** (Netlify or Vercel)
2. **Open DevTools** (F12) → Console tab
3. **Look for:** `🌐 API Base URL: https://health-management-app-joj5.onrender.com/api`
4. **Try to save something** (add vital, medication, etc.)
5. **Watch console logs:**

**Expected on FIRST request (cold start):**
```
📡 API Call: POST https://health-management-app-joj5.onrender.com/api/vitals
⏳ Retrying in 1000ms... (Backend may be waking up)
⏳ Retrying in 2000ms... (Backend may be waking up)
✅ API Response: 200 OK
```

**Expected on subsequent requests:**
```
📡 API Call: POST https://health-management-app-joj5.onrender.com/api/vitals
✅ API Response: 200 OK
```

### Step 3: What to Do If Still Failing

**If you see this in console:**
```
❌ API call attempt 3/3 failed
```

**Check these:**

1. **Is backend URL correct?**
   - Should be: `https://health-management-app-joj5.onrender.com/api`
   - NOT: `https://noncondescendingly-phonometric-ken.ngrok-free.dev`
   - If wrong URL appears, your deployment hasn't rebuilt yet

2. **Is backend running?**
   - Visit: https://health-management-app-joj5.onrender.com
   - Should show: `{"success":true,"message":"Healthcare API Server"...}`
   - If 404 or error, backend has an issue

3. **Check Render logs:**
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Click on your service
   - View "Logs" tab
   - Look for errors

4. **Check CORS:**
   - Look for: `CORS request from origin: https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app`
   - Should show: `Allowing Vercel/Netlify deployment`

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fixes

### First Request After Backend Sleep (30-60s):
```
User clicks "Save"
  ↓
"Processing... (Backend may be waking up)" toast shows
  ↓
Wait 30-60 seconds (Render waking up)
  ↓
Request succeeds
  ↓
"Success" toast shows
```

### Subsequent Requests (< 1s):
```
User clicks "Save"
  ↓
"Processing..." toast shows
  ↓
Request succeeds immediately
  ↓
"Success" toast shows
```

### After UptimeRobot Setup (Always < 1s):
```
User clicks "Save"
  ↓
"Processing..." toast shows
  ↓
Request succeeds immediately (backend never sleeps)
  ↓
"Success" toast shows
```

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade Render ($7/month)
**Pros:**
- Backend never sleeps
- Instant response times
- More resources

**Cons:**
- Costs money

### Option 2: Deploy Backend Elsewhere
**Free options that don't sleep:**
- Railway (500 hours/month free)
- Fly.io (3 apps free)
- Cyclic (serverless, no sleep)

### Option 3: Accept the Cold Starts
- Use UptimeRobot (free)
- Users wait on first request only
- Show better loading messages

## 📋 Checklist

Before asking for help, verify:

- [ ] Commit `a067a52` is deployed on Netlify/Vercel
- [ ] Browser console shows correct API URL (Render, not ngrok)
- [ ] Backend is accessible: https://health-management-app-joj5.onrender.com
- [ ] Tried saving something and waited 60+ seconds
- [ ] Checked browser console for detailed error logs
- [ ] Checked Render logs during save attempt
- [ ] Setup UptimeRobot (highly recommended!)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First load after deployment:**
   - Always wait 60 seconds on first save
   - Backend needs time to wake up
   - This is normal with Render free tier

2. **Keep backend awake:**
   - Use UptimeRobot (best option)
   - Or upgrade Render to paid tier

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode

4. **Check which deployment:**
   - Production: `nuviacare-health-manager.vercel.app`
   - NOT preview: `nuviacare-health-manager-[hash].vercel.app`
